A Delivery Route Modeling Application
=====================================

.. _this-project-demonstrates-:

This Project Demonstrates :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Non-Linear Data
    -  The software application incorporates non-linear data structures for
       efficient and maintainable software.
#. Hashing Algorithms and Structures
    -  The application uses hashing techniques within written code to perform
       searching operations.
#. Dictionaries and Sets
    -  Dictionaries and sets are incorporated in order to organize data into
       key-value pairs.
#. Self-Adjusting Data Structures
    -  The space and time complexity of self-adjusting data structures has been
       evaluated using big-O notation to improve the performance of the
       application.
#. Self-Adjusting Heuristics
    -  The written code uses self-adjusting heuristics to improve the
       performance of the application.
#. NP-Completeness and Turing Machines
    -  Computational complexity theories were evaluated in order to apply models
       to specific scenarios.

.. _scenario-:

Scenario :
----------

The Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS) needs to determine the
best route and delivery distribution for their Daily Local Deliveries. The Salt
Lake City Daily Local Delivery route has three trucks, two drivers, and an
average of 40 packages to deliver each day; each package has specific criteria
and delivery requirements.

The supervisor (user) needs the means to check the status of any given package
at any given time using package IDs. The report should also include the delivery
times, which packages are at the hub, and en route. The intent is to use this
program for this specific location and use the same program in different cities
as WGUPS expands its business. As such, you will need to include detailed
comments following the industry-standards to make your code easy to read and
justifying the decisions you made while writing your program.

.. _usage-how-to-run-the-program-:

Usage *(how to run the program)* :
----------------------------------

#. Enter ``1`` to view delivery status of all packages by the end of the day.
#. Enter ``2``; enter a time; enter Package ID to view the status of that package
   at the specified time.
#. Enter ``3`` and a time to view status of all packages at the specified
   time.
#. Enter ``4`` to quit the application.
